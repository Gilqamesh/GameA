Runescape-like RPG
Procedurally generated openworld
Most of the contect in the game is reachable and not locked behind progression
Player can start in different kind environments

Getting assets (sound, animation, texture)
Content creation (map, levels)

In order to parallelise the transforms, need: dependecies between them
    - each thread runs transforms on connected graphs only
    - since false sharing happen only on write and not read, reading from a table doesn't build a dependecy for that table
        for a specific transform
